### Machine Learning: Predicting Customer Churn  

In today's competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial. Telco serves a diverse range of customers who subscribe to its services. However, predicting whether a customer will churn (discontinue the service) within a few days can offer a significant edge. By analyzing key factors such as **billing preferences**, **age**, and **relationship status**, we can uncover patterns that lead to churn and identify opportunities to prevent it.  

Imagine being able to proactively address these issues before customers decide to leave. By understanding what drives customer behavior, Telco can design personalized plans and services to keep customers engaged.  

### Why Does It Matter?  
A deeper analysis of influential factors like payment methods, contract terms, and customer demographics can help businesses:  
- **Retain Existing Customers**: Build loyalty by addressing churn-inducing pain points.  
- **Attract New Customers**: Implement strategies that target the needs of prospective customers.  
- **Maximize Revenue**: Retention-focused approaches lead to long-term profitability and sustainable growth.  

With machine learning and data analysis, Telco can transform insights into actionable strategies, ensuring customers not only stay but also recommend their services to others.

# üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in understanding the dataset. It helps uncover hidden patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

### Key Insights:
* The total monthly charges for customers who did not churn ("No") are significantly higher than those for customers who churned ("Yes").
* The TotalCharges for Fiber Optic users are significantly higher than DSL users. This indicates Fiber Optic is the primary revenue driver and is valued more by customers.
* The total charges for Paperless Billing customers are 306,792.80 compared to 149,323.80 for non-Paperless Billing customers. This suggests that Paperless Billing might be associated with higher-value services or plans.
* Since we got a statically significant result , it means the Customers who dont churn are performing way better than those who churn

  ## Visualizations

In this section, we showcase the key visualizations that play a crucial role in the journey of understanding our data. From exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering and the predictions of our machine learning models, these visualizations help us make sense of complex information. They not only provide deeper insights into the data but also guide us in making better decisions on how to build and refine our models.

One of the images here gives us a clear view of the input data, highlighting a few of the most important features and attributes that machine learning models use to predict customer churn. This is the heart of our data: a collection of attributes that, when well-understood, help us craft more accurate models and enhance the performance of our predictions.

It‚Äôs important to note that while this image illustrates only a selection of features, our dataset contains many more. However, these are the key highlights to show the potential of what we can achieve with the right understanding and approach.

The image shows a summary of dataset statistics and variable types from a data analysis report. It provides an overview of the dataset, including the number of variables, number of observations, missing cells, duplicate rows, total size in memory, and average record size in memory. Additionally, it categorizes the variable types into text, categorical, boolean, and numeric.

The plot below displays the total number of data points categorized by gender. The number of male and female participants appears to be roughly equal, indicating that there is no significant class imbalance. Therefore, metrics such as accuracy can be used with confidence in evaluating the model's performance.

The majority of participants chose electronic checks as their preferred payment method, with a smaller portion selecting mailed checks. Additionally, some participants opted for the convenience of automatic credit card payments.

This revision provides a clearer breakdown of the different payment methods chosen by participants and avoids the use of the word "default," which could imply that electronic checks were the only option or the preferred choice for all participants. The revised statement also emphasizes the convenience factor of automatic credit card payments, which could be helpful information for future payment processing considerations.

The information that a vast majority of participants have month-to-month contracts compared to longer term contracts could potentially be used to predict churn in customers. Here are a few ways this information could be helpful in predicting churn:

* Shorter term contracts may indicate that customers are more likely to be price-sensitive and looking for flexibility. Therefore, price changes or lack of flexibility could be potential drivers of churn.
* Month-to-month contracts may suggest that customers are more willing to switch providers or cancel their service. This could increase the risk of churn if competitors offer more attractive alternatives.
* Customers on shorter term contracts may be less committed to the service, and therefore less likely to recommend it to others or refer new customers.
  
By analyzing these potential drivers of churn and monitoring customer behavior over time, companies could develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn. For example, they could offer more flexible pricing options, improve customer service, or provide incentives to encourage customers to commit to longer term contracts.

##  Device Protection Revenue
* The total monthly revenue generated from Device Protection is $9.5 million.
* This indicates that Device Protection is a significant revenue driver for the business.
* The segment with "No Internet Service" has a monthly revenue of $1.0 million from Device Protection.
* This suggests that even customers without internet service are still opting for Device Protection, likely due to the value proposition of protecting their devices
* The segment with "No" Device Protection has a monthly revenue of $5.6 million.
* This presents an opportunity to upsell Device Protection to these customers, potentially increasing revenue.

The boxplot shows the distribution of Total Charges across different types of Internet Service (DSL, Fiber optic, and No service)
 
  
  ![](assets/Medians.png)

  **Insights**
  
  * Customers using Fiber optic have significantly higher median Total Charges compared to other service types.
  * The range of charges for Fiber optic is also broader, indicating higher revenue potential from these customers.
  * Customers with DSL have a lower median Total Charges than Fiber optic but higher than those with no internet service.

 "Dunn's test results show statistically significant differences in Total Charges across all pairs of Internet Service categories (DSL, Fiber optic, No service). This finding underscores the importance of segmentation and targeted strategies to maximize revenue from high-value segments (e.g., Fiber optic) and improve retention or upsell opportunities for lower-value groups."

### MACHINE LEARNINING MODEL PERFORMANCE
We can evaluate the performance of ML models in this section. A list of models that I have tried are presented along with confusion matrix and AUC curves. We can get a good understanding of the model performance by visually inspecting the plots. After this step, we can select the best model to be hyperparameter tuned and deployed in real-time.

# ***Logistic Regression Performance***

We will take a look at the performance of ML models on the test data. Confusion matrix gives a good representation of the total number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. In addition, this can also help determine the total accuracy, precision, recall and f1-scores using formulas.

![](assets/logistic.png)

The AUC score for the classifier is about 0.85 respectively. It does a decent job of classifying whether customers are going to churn from the service or not. We can also explore other models that can also improve AUC scores even further.

# ***XGBOOST CLASSIFIER*** :

After looking at the confusion matrix of xgboost classifier, it could be found that there are only quite a few false positives and false negatives. Therefore, this model is performing quite well. There are about 199 false positives which means that the model does a decent job of identifying people who are going to churn from various services.
